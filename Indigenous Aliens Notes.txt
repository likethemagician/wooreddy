	indigenous aliens being colonized, procedurally generated world featuring multiple lang families and cultural/technological systems
		combat
		trade
		assimilation
		extermination
		-play as random station in society

		children & spouses

	language generator, perhaps with game that features communication using unknown language
		would require semantic map, hand/tentacle sign correlation
		randomly generated grammar, mostly reflecting 
		dictionary lookup once you learn the language
		series of encounters that teach you the language
		glossing
		learning lang during childhood period
		language variation by geography: greater distance = greater deviation from home lang with isoglosses
